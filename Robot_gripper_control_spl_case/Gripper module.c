 This application example demonstrates operation of two servo motor based small gripper which is fitted in front of 
 Fire Bird V ATMEGA2560 4 Wheel Drive Robot. In this application example robot will move forward, grip an object, 
 lift it up and move to other place and put it there.


 Concepts covered: Servo motor control, robot motion control

 Servo control:
  Fire Bird V ATMEGA2560 microcontroller board has connection for 3 servo motors (S1, S2, S3).
 Servo motors move between 0 to 180 degrees proportional to the pulse train 
 with the on time of 1 to 2 ms with the frequency between 40 to 60 Hz. 50Hz is most recommended.

 We are using Timer 1 at 10 bit fast PWM mode to generate servo control waveform.
 In this mode servo motors can be controlled with the angular resolution of 2.25 degrees.
 Although angular resolution is less this is very simple method.
 
 There are better ways to produce very high resolution PWM but it involves interrupts at the frequency of the PWM.
 High resolution PWM is used for servo control in the Hexapod robot.
  
 Connection Details:	PORTB 5 OC1A --> Servo 1: Camera pod pan servo
 						PORTB 6 OC1B --> Servo 2: Grip servo
						PORTB 7 OC1C --> Servo 3: Robot arm up/down servo 

 Motion control:
 There are two components to the motion control:
 1. Direction control using pins PORTA0 to PORTA3
 2. Velocity control by PWM on pins PL3 and PL4 using OC5A and OC5B.

 
  
 Connection Details:  	L-1---->PA0;		L-2---->PA1;
   						R-1---->PA2;		R-2---->PA3;
   						PL3 (OC5A) ----> PWM left; 	PL4 (OC5B) ----> PWM right; 


 Note: 
 
 1. Make sure that in the configuration options following settings are 
 	done for proper operation of the code

 	Microcontroller: atmega2560
 	Frequency: 14745600
 	Optimization: -O0 (For more information read section: Selecting proper optimization options 
						below figure 2.20 in the Software Manual)

 2. 5V supply to these motors is provided by separate low drop voltage regulator "5V Servo" which can
 	supply maximum of 800mA current. It is a good practice to move one servo at a time to reduce power surge 
	in the robot's supply lines. Also preferably take ADC readings while servo motor is not moving or stopped
	moving after giving desired position.

 3. Look carefully at the functions object_grip(); and object_ungrip();
    After gripping and ungripping the object it is making grip servo free to reduce current consumption.
	Never ever allow grip and arm up down servo to stall for more than 10 to 15 seconds in order to avoid
	damage to the servo motor because of over heating.
